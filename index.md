Skywriting
==========

<img alt="Skywriting Logo" src="images/sw-logo.png" style="border: none"/> Skywriting is a programming language and execution engine for distributed, parallel computation. Like previous frameworks (such as [MapReduce](http://labs.google.com/papers/mapreduce.html) and [Dryad](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/dryad/)), it masks the complexity of distributed programming. Unlike those frameworks, it offers a full general-purpose programming language for expressing distributed coordination, which enables developers to implement algorithms using arbitrary task structures.
